        <h2>This section is going to be about me!</h2>

        <p>
            My name is Nicholas Bargy and I am a Junior at Michigan State University. I study information science and am not too sure what I want to do with the degree or even after graduation. I am a proud father of two cats, and have found myself becoming interested in sports during my free time. I also played soccer for about 10 years of my life and stopped after my sophomore year of high school. I ended up falling behind my peers and decided to focus on school.
