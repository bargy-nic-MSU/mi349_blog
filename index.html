                <h3>Hello this is my very first blog, and is going to be about my cats!</h3>

                <div>
                    Cats are awesome and I have two myself! My two cats are just over a year old and are very full of life, especially when it comes to feeding time. Always an ear full when that comes around. They are two gray tabby cats that I found off of petfinder. They are sisters from the same litter and are inseparable from each other. Their names are Gucci and Prada, and those were the names they had when I got them. Prada likes to wake me up by trying to dig herself under my covers so she can lay next to my legs. Gucci tends to take the more aggressive approach and yells at me until I wake up because I inconvenience her breakfast time. They both are extremely cuddly and very friendly with everyone. When I first got them it was a bit of a struggle to get them to accept me and my affection, but after about a week both of them were waiting by my door for me to come back home from class. Now if I leave my bedroom and go out into my common room, they have to follow me or they will make sure I hear their displeasure.

            <h2>The Lions and their run in the NFC North</h2>

            <article class="blog-post">
                <h3>This blog will be about how the Lions are having a historically good run in the NFL.</h3>

                <div>
                    The Lions have been a historically not so great team when it comes to the NFL era of football. Before the NFL they were a multi time championship winning team, but when the Lions migrated to the NFL they seemed to lose their touch when it came to the game. They had flashes of doing well but they could never go all the way, only getting close once in recent times. As of recently though, they have finally found the right pieces to their puzzle. Last year they took home a playoff win for the first time since the Soviet Union was dismantled, and not only that they made it to the NFC championship game, which they also have not gotten to since the Soviet Union collapsed. They were able to get this far because they also placed first in the NFC North, the division they play in, which has not been a title they had taken home ever. During the 2024 season they have been recreating the success that they found in 2023, but unfortunately they just lost their star defensive player Aiden Hutchinson to a broken tibia on sunday night football against the Cowboys. He will be out for the season and therefore having a massive impact on the rest of the Lions season.
